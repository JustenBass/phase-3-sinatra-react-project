‚úàÔ∏è INTRODUCTION-

Hello, my fellow coders and viewers. The time has come after months of studies and practice to present to you my third web application. I'm excited to showcase the new skills and knowledge that I have adapted from Ruby to create this Object Oriented Programming application. Learning Ruby had it's challenges seeing that we're not only working with front-end but also back-end. Combining two seprate languages and understanding how to sync the two together was complex yet so satisfying. It was incredible to see Javascript interact with OOP and it's database. I now have an even broader vision on how to keep applications dynamic and functional.


‚úàÔ∏è What is the goal of Chaotic Errands?

The initial goal of creating Chaotic Errands is to allow our users to keep up to date with thier personal errands. Days, weeks, and even months fly by in time before we even realize it. It's easy to forget an event you may have to attend or even dinner plans with friends when life gets overwhelming. It's hard to create old school habits by grabbing a pen and jotting down our errands on a calander. After all, we do live in a high tech world in this day and age. With having smart phones and computers in eyes view at all times, why would'nt we create an interavtive calander that allows us to keep our day to day organized?


‚úàÔ∏è The ideas behind the application.

 I wanted to create an application that was clean and simple. When you visit our web application our goal is to make sure the user doesn't question what to do and how to do it. Life get's busy and there's a comfort that comes with knowing you can keep control of your day to day. But to keep control we need tools in life that give us the opportunity to do so. I did'nt want my users to put to much work in posting, editing, and deleting thier errands. The purpose is to make interacing with the application efficent where the user feels in control of thier current and future plans. Chaotic Errands is here to do just that.
